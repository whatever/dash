# dash

An always-on assistant in front of [hermes-agent](https://github.com/whatever/geometry.dev/tree/main/apps/hermes-agent).

| Part | What it does |
|---|---|
| Web UI (`src/dash/static`) | Chat, memories (list, search, add, delete), connected apps, and queue status. No build step. |
| API (`dash serve`) | FastAPI. Stores each user message, then adds a job to the Redis stream `dash:jobs`. |
| Worker (`dash worker`) | Reads `dash:jobs`, recalls memories from pgvector, and streams the hermes reply. Then it extracts new memories. |
| Memories | Postgres + pgvector. Bedrock Titan v2 makes the embeddings. Bedrock Haiku extracts the facts. |
| App keys | A self-hosted [Nango](https://nango.dev). Nango holds the OAuth tokens. dash and hermes ask Nango for them. |
| GitHub (`src/dash/github`) | Creates a private GitHub App from a manifest and stores its keys in the `authorizations` table. Use `app_client` and `installation_client` to call GitHub. |

The browser follows a reply through `GET /api/jobs/<id>/events` (SSE). The worker writes each reply to its own Redis stream, so a page reload replays the reply from the start.

## Run locally

The compose stack runs everything, Nango included. Nango needs `NANGO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`. Make it with `openssl rand -base64 32`.

```sh
cp .env.example .env   # then set NANGO_ENCRYPTION_KEY
just up                # also: just down, just nuke, just logs [service], just ps
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 (dash) and http://localhost:3003 (Nango, user `admin`). See `compose.yaml` for the other ports.

To run dash outside Docker:

```sh
docker run -d --name pg -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dash pgvector/pgvector:pg16
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:8-alpine
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:dash@localhost:5432/postgres
export HERMES_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8642/v1 HERMES_API_KEY=...
uv run dash migrate
uv run dash worker &
uv run dash serve
```

The worker needs AWS credentials for Bedrock in the standard env chain. Outside Docker, Nango is optional. To use it, set `NANGO_URL` and `NANGO_SECRET_KEY`.

## GitHub

In the Apps tab, click **Create GitHub App**. Type an organization, or leave it empty for your personal account.

1. dash sends a manifest to GitHub. The manifest has the name, permissions, and redirect URLs.
2. On GitHub, you confirm the app. GitHub sends you back to `/github/callback` with a code.
3. dash exchanges the code for the app ID, private key, client secret, and webhook secret. Then it stores them.
4. GitHub opens the install page. After you install, `/github/setup` copies the installations from GitHub.

dash stores the private key and secrets as plain JSONB. Protect the database.

## Settings

| Env var | Default |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | (required) |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://localhost:6379/0` |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | Browser-facing dash address for GitHub redirects. Empty means the request address. |
| `HERMES_BASE_URL`, `HERMES_API_KEY`, `HERMES_MODEL` | `http://localhost:8642/v1`, empty, `hermes-opus` |
| `NANGO_URL`, `NANGO_SECRET_KEY` | `http://localhost:3003`, empty (disabled) |
| `NANGO_PUBLIC_URL`, `NANGO_CONNECT_URL` | Browser-facing Nango API and Connect UI addresses |
| `EMBED_MODEL`, `EXTRACT_MODEL`, `MEMORY_TOP_K` | Titan v2, Haiku 4.5, `8` |

## Deploy

`chart/` holds the Helm chart. It deploys the API, the worker, Redis (AOF), Nango, ExternalSecrets, and the Traefik ingress. On each push to `main`, CI does two things:
1. It publishes the image `ghcr.io/whatever/dash:sha-<short>`.
2. It publishes the chart to `oci://ghcr.io/whatever/charts/dash`, with version `<chart version>-sha-<short>` and that image as the default.

```sh
helm install dash oci://ghcr.io/whatever/charts/dash --version 0.1.0-sha-abc1234 -n dash --create-namespace
kubectl label namespace dash geometry.dev/geometry-config=true
```

Before you install, do these steps:
1. On RDS, as the master user, create the `dash` and `nango` databases. Then run `CREATE EXTENSION vector` in `dash`.
2. Add `DASH_DATABASE_URL` and `NANGO_DATABASE_URL` to `geometry/config`.
3. Create `geometry/dash` with `NANGO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `NANGO_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`. Make the key with `openssl rand -base64 32`. Do not rotate it.
4. After Nango starts for the first time, copy `NANGO_SECRET_KEY` from its dashboard into `geometry/dash` and `geometry/hermes`.

`hermes/skills/nango/SKILL.md` is the hermes skill for connected apps. To use it, copy it into your hermes skills.
